#What's been done

I've created a number of empty "mini-modules" with names that reflect our list of learning objectives, as well as a number of "issues", which are smaller chunks of each section that need to be tackled.

##Proposed plan of action

###Issues
  1. Look through the issues list and claim the ones that you want to work on
  2. If you're starting from a blank page, feel free to "Commit directly to the master branch" so we get the basics of the lessons
  3. Once there's a basis to a lesson, or if you've chosen an "edit" type issue use "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request." so other can comment on your changes before we accept them
  4. Be sure to claim an issue before you start to work on it, so we don't have to do too much de-convoluting simultanous changes
  5. Make your own issues! If you get stuck on your lesson, request help with an issue. No request is too small
  6. Check the issues frequently! Even if you don't have a ton of time to help, some issues are as simple as "add a link" or "check my grammar"
  7. If you have ideas you want to discuss, we can also do that as a discussion thread on an issue, just tag it as a question

###MiniModules
  1. If you want to be completely in charge of a mini-module, make it an issue, and then claim it
  2. You can change the name of the mini-modules by clicking **edit** and then changing the path text. We're going to arrange them from 00 to N once they're completed
  3. If you don't see the mini-module you want, create it
  4. If your module has data to be given to learners, they can be inline in the instructor document, but also put a copy in the data folder
