In our experiments we're usually generating our own genomic data, but many types of analyses use reference data or you may want to use it to compare your results or annotate your data with publicly available data. You may also want to do a full project or set of analyses using publicly available data. This data is a great, and essential, resource for genomic data analysis.

There are many repositories for public data. Some model organisms or fields have specific databases, and there are ones for particular types of data. Two of the most comprehensive are the [National Center for Biotechnology Information  (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and [European Nucleotide Archive (EMBL-EBI)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). In this lesson we're working with the NCBI database, but the general process is the same for any database.

# Accessing the original archived data

The [sequencing dataset (from Tenaillon paper) adapted for this lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/data/) was obtained from the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) which is a large (>3 quadrillion basepairs as of 2014) repository for next-generation sequence data. Like many NCBI databases, it is complex and mastering its use is greater than the scope of this lesson. Very often there will be a direct link (perhaps in the supplemental information) to where on the SRA the dataset can be found. We have provided one link from the Tenaillon paper here: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRA026813](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRA026813). See the figures below for how the data was formatted in the original paper. In this case, the authors provided a "PRJNA" accession which is a BioProject identifier. Accession numbers will often also start with either ERX, ERR, DRX, DRR, SRX, or SRR.

The above image shows the title of the study, as well as the authors.

This next image shows an excerpt from the paper in the section where the accession was reported. In this case, this section occurred after the reference section.

## Locate the Run Accessory Table for the Lenski Dataset on the SRA

1. Access the Tenaillon dataset from the provided link: [https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP064605](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP064605).  
You will be presented with a page for the overall SRA accession SRP064605 - this is a collection of all the experimental data.

2. Click on the first entry ([REL4541B](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR2591054)). This will take you to a page that is a run browser. Take a few minutes to examine some of the descriptions on the page.

3. Go back to the ['previous page'](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/?acc=SRP064605). At the top of the page and in the **Total** row you will see there are 312 runs, 109.43 Gb data, and 168.81 Gbases of data. Click the 'RunInfo Table' button and save the file locally.

We are not downloading any actual sequence data here! This is only a text file that fully describes the entire
dataset.  

You should now have a file called `SraRunTable.txt`

## Review the SraRunTable in a spreadsheet program


Using your choice of spreadsheet program open the `SraRunTable.txt` file. If prompted this is a tab-delimited file (`.tsv`).

> ## Discussion  
> Discuss with the person next to you:
>
> 1. What strain of *E. coli* was used in this experiment?
> 2. What was the sequencing platform used for this experiment?
> 3. What samples in the experiment contain
> [paired end](http://www.illumina.com/technology/next-generation-sequencing/paired-end-sequencing_assay.html)
> sequencing data?
> 4. What other kind of data is available?
> 5. Are you collecting this kind of information about your sequencing runs?
{: .challenge}

After answering the questions, you should avoid saving any changes you might have made to this file. We don't want to make any changes. If you were to save this file, make sure you save it as a plain `.txt` file.

## Downloading a few sequencing files: EMBL-EBI 

The SRA does not support direct download of fastq files from its webpage. However, the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) does. Let's see how we can get a download link to a file we are interested in. 

1. Navigate to the [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena).

2. In the search bar, type in `SRR2589044`. Make sure there are no spaces after the accession number, and press search.

3. You will see a table with information about the sample. In the table, there is a header "FASTQ files (FTP)". If you wanted to download the files to your computer, you could click on the links to download the files. Alternatively, right click and copy the URL to save it for later. We don't need to download these files right now, and because they are large we won't put them on our computers now.

We don't recommend downloading large numbers of sequencing files this way. For that, the NCBI has made a software package called the `sra-toolkit`. However, for a couple files, it's often easier to go through the ENA. 

## Where to learn more

#### About the Sequence Read Archive

* You can learn more about the SRA by reading the [SRA Documentation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/)  
* The best way to transfer a large SRA dataset is by using the [SRA Toolkit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?view=toolkit_doc)
